    <h2>Laura :)</h2>
    <p>Hi! My name is Laura, and this webcomic is inspired by my first experiences in Theater during Middle school! I decided to base this short webcomic on the commonly shared experince of not getting the role you additioned for. In this webcomic, the girl auditioned for the lead female role, and ended up as the understudy for the lead instead. I wanted to depict the crushing feeling of rejection a new actor faces when being cast as the understudy to their first choice role. Thanks for viewing! </p>
